#### exec
Syntax: `exec command arg*`  
Context: rtmp, server, application

`exec` is an alias of `exec_push`

#### exec_options
Syntax: `exec_options on|off`  
Context: ~~rtmp, server,~~ application (see [#1316](https://github.com/arut/nginx-rtmp-module/issues/1316))

The directive toggles exec options mode. When activated you can
add exec-family directive options. The only exec option supported is `name`.
This option makes it possible to apply exec only to specified stream.
Default if off.

    exec_options on;
    # call my_on_publish_command only for "mystream"
    exec_publish my_on_publish_command name=mystream;

    # call my_on_play_command only for "another"
    exec_play my_on_play_command name=another;

    # execute different ffmpeg's for different streams
    exec_pull ffmpeg -i http://example.com/abc.ts -c copy -f flv rtmp://localhost/$name/$app name=mystream;
    exec_pull ffmpeg -i http://my.example.com/tele.ts -c copy -f flv rtmp://localhost/$name/$app name=tv;
    exec_pull ffmpeg -i http://another.example.com/hello/f.ts -c copy -f flv rtmp://localhost/$name/$app name=fun;

#### exec_static
Syntax: `exec_static command arg*`  
Context: rtmp, server, application

Similar to `exec` but runs specified command at nginx start.
Does not support substitutions since has no session context.

    exec_static ffmpeg -i http://example.com/video.ts -c copy -f flv rtmp://localhost/myapp/mystream;

#### exec_kill_signal
Syntax: `exec_kill_signal signal`  
Context: rtmp, server, application  

Sets process termination signal. Default is kill (SIGKILL).
You can specify numeric or symbolic name (for POSIX.1-1990 signals).

    exec_kill_signal term;
    exec_kill_signal usr1;
    exec_kill_signal 3;

#### respawn
Syntax: `respawn on|off`  
Context: rtmp, server, application  

If turned on respawns child process when it's terminated while publishing
is still on. Default is on;

    respawn off;

#### respawn_timeout
Syntax: `respawn_timeout timeout`  
Context: rtmp, server, application  

Sets respawn timeout to wait before starting new child instance.
Default is 5 seconds.

    respawn_timeout 10s;

#### exec_publish

Context: rtmp, server, application

holding query string arguments.

#### exec_play
Syntax: `exec_play command arg*`  
Context: rtmp, server, application

is the same as for `exec_publish`.

#### exec_play_done
Syntax: `exec_play_done command arg*`  
Context: rtmp, server, application

Specifies external command with arguments to be executed on
play_done event. Return code is not analyzed. Substitution list
is the same as for `exec_publish`.

#### exec_publish_done
Syntax: `exec_publish_done command arg*`  
Context: rtmp, server, application

Specifies external command with arguments to be executed on
publish_done event. Return code is not analyzed. Substitution list
is the same as for `exec_publish`.

#### exec_record_done
Syntax: `exec_record_done command arg*`  
Context: rtmp, server, application, recorder

Specifies external command with arguments to be executed when
recording is finished. Substitution of `exec_publish` are supported here
as well as additional variables 
* `recorder` - recorder name
* `path` - recorded file path (`/tmp/rec/mystream-1389499351.flv`)
* `filename` - path with directory omitted (`mystream-1389499351.flv`)
* `basename` - file name with extension omitted (`mystream-1389499351`)
* `dirname` - directory path (`/tmp/rec`)

Examples

    # track client info
    exec_play bash -c "echo $addr $pageurl >> /tmp/clients";
    exec_publish bash -c "echo $addr $flashver >> /tmp/publishers";

    # convert recorded file to mp4 format
    exec_record_done ffmpeg -y -i $path -acodec libmp3lame -ar 44100 -ac 1 -vcodec libx264 $dirname/$basename.mp4;
